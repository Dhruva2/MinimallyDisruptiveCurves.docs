# Installation

\toc

## Dependencies
- Make sure you have a working installation of Julia v1.3 or above.

```julia:./exdot.jl
using LinearAlgebra
a = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2]
@show dot(a, a)
println(dot(a, a))
```

You can now show what this would look like:

\output{./exdot.jl}


Here's another example,

```julia:./code/ex2
for i ∈ 1:5, j ∈ 1:5
    print(" ", rpad("*"^i,5), lpad("*"^(6-i),5), j==5 ? "\n" : " "^4)
end
```

which gives the (utterly useless):

\output{./code/ex2}

note the absence of `.jl`, it's inferred.

You can also hide lines (that will be executed nonetheless):

```julia:./code/ex3
using Random
Random.seed!(1) # hide
@show randn(2)
```

\output{./code/ex3}


## Including scripts

Another approach is to include the content of a script that has already been executed.
This can be an alternative to the description above if you'd like to only run the code once because it's particularly slow or because it's not Julia code.
For this you can use the `\input` command specifying which language it should be tagged as:


\input{julia}{/_assets/scripts/script1.jl} <!--_-->


these scripts can be run in such a way that their output is also saved to file, see `scripts/generate_results.jl` for instance, and you can then also input the results:

\output{/_assets/scripts/script1.jl} <!--_-->

which is convenient if you're presenting code.

**Note**: paths specification matters, see [the docs](https://tlienart.github.io/franklindocs/code/index.html#more_on_paths) for details.

Using this approach with the `generate_results.jl` file also makes sure that all the code on your website works and that all results match the code which makes maintenance easier.
