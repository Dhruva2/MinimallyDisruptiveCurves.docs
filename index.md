### Context
<!-- **The Context** -->
- You have a mathematical model of a (mechanical/biological/...) system
- The model works (you've tweaked parameters until it matches data/ a desired set of behaviours).
- You care about how the parameters relate to each other 
\\
~~~
<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">Now you want to use your model to say something clever!</p> 
~~~
\\
### Standard questions
<!-- **Next Questions**: -->
- Are some model interactions unnecessary? Which ones?
- What spaces of parameters are (approximately/exactly) consistent with the data?
- Could changes in parameter $x$ could be compensated for by changes in parameters $y$ and $z$? Or by $u$, $v$, and $w$? 
- Is there a hidden approximation you could make in the model that wouldn't greatly change behaviour?

## What it does

At its' core, only one thing: 

> Finds functional relationships between model parameters that best preserves model behaviour.

We'll gradually unpack exactly what this means, and how you can use it to answer different model-related questions. First some background.

### This is *not* model-fitting, but let's recap that anyway

Think about the problem of tuning a model parameters to fit data/recreate a desired behaviour. The flow diagram might look something like this:
\\ \\
~~~
<div class="row">
  <div class="container">
    <img class="center" src="/assets/loss_schematic.svg">
    <div style="clear: both"></div>      
  </div>
</div>
~~~
\\ \\
- A fixed model structure has variable parameters. The behaviour of the model changes with the parameters. Some behaviours are more desirable than others. We quantify this through a loss function, which reduces model behaviour to a scalar number. 
- For instance if we are fitting a model to data, the loss function might measure the discrepancy between model predictions and data. The lower the value of the loss, the more desirable the model behaviour.
- So we can factor out the model, and just consider a function mapping parameter values to 'loss' (ie an inverse measure of model desirability).
\\ \\

<div class="row">
  <div class="container">
    <img class="right" src="/assets/reduced_loss_schematic.svg">
    <div style="clear: both"></div>      
  </div>
</div>
~~~
\\ \\



- **Model fitting** (also known as training, optimisation, calibration, ...) consists of minimising the loss as a function of the parameters. So, finding the set of parameters that results in the 'most desirable' model behaviour. 
- We can consider the loss function as a landscape, where height represents the value of the loss, and the x-y co-ordinates represent parameter values. Model fitting then consists of getting to the deepest point of the landscape (see schematic below).

### Minimally disruptive curves on parameter space


So we've recalled how model-fitting can be conceptualised as descending to the bottom of a 'loss landscape'. Imagine you've got to the bottom, and on your journey have acquired a healthy dose of altitude sickness. There, you encounter a strange man filled with murderous intent. Where would you run to get away from him? That's where the minimally disruptive curve will go.

## How it's useful


## Getting started

or code-blocks `inline` or with highlighting (note the `@def hascode = true` in the source to allow [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) to do its job):

```julia
abstract type Point end
struct PointR2{T<:Real} <: Point
    x::T
    y::T
end
struct PointR3{T<:Real} <: Point
    x::T
    y::T
    z::T
end
function len(p::T) where T<:Point
  sqrt(sum(getfield(p, Î·)^2 for Î· âˆˆ fieldnames(T)))
end
```

You can also quote stuff

> You must have chaos within you to ...

or have tables:

| English         | Mandarin   |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| winnie the pooh | ç»´å°¼ç†Š      |

Note that you may have to do a bit of CSS-styling to get these elements to look the way you want them (the same holds for the whole page in fact).

### Symbols and html entities

If you want a dollar sign you have to escape it like so: \$, you can also use html entities like so: &rarr; or &pi; or, if you're using Juno for instance, you can use `\pi[TAB]` to insert the symbol as is: Ï€ (it will be converted to a html entity).[^1]

If you want to show a backslash, just use it like so: \ ; if you want to force a line break, use a ` \\ ` like \\ so (this is on a new line).[^blah]

If you want to show a backtick, escape it like so: \` and if you want to show a tick in inline code use double backticks like ``so ` ...``.

Footnotes are nice too:

[^1]: this is the text for the first footnote, you can style all this looking at `.fndef` elements; note that the whole footnote definition is _expected to be on the same line_.
[^blah]: and this is a longer footnote with some blah from veggie ipsum: turnip greens yarrow ricebean rutabaga endive cauliflower sea lettuce kohlrabi amaranth water spinach avocado daikon napa cabbage asparagus winter purslane kale. Celery potato scallion desert raisin horseradish spinach carrot soko.

## Basic Franklin extensions

### Divs

It is sometimes useful to have a short way to make a part of the page belong to a div so that it can be styled separately.
You can do this easily with Franklin by using `@@divname ... @@`.
For instance, you could want a blue background behind some text.

@@colbox-blue
Here we go! (this is styled in the css sheet with name "colbox-blue").
@@

Since it's just a `<div>` block, you can put this construction wherever you like and locally style your text.


\newcommand{\E}[1]{\mathbb E\left[#1\right]}

Now we can write something like

$$  \varphi(\E{X}) \le \E{\varphi(X)}. \label{equation blah} $$

since we've given it the label `\label{equation blah}`, we can refer it like so: \eqref{equation blah} which can be convenient for pages that are math-heavy.

In a similar vein you can cite references that would be at the bottom of the page: \citep{noether15, bezanson17}.

**Note**: the LaTeX commands you define can also incorporate standard markdown (though not in a math environment) so for instance let's define a silly `\bolditalic` command.

\newcommand{\bolditalic}[1]{_**!#1**_} <!--_ ignore this comment, it helps atom to not get confused by the trailing underscore when highlighting the code but is not necessary.-->

and use it \bolditalic{here for example}.

Here's another quick one, a command to change the color:

\newcommand{\col}[2]{~~~<span style="color:#1">#2</span>~~~}

This is \col{blue}{in blue} or \col{#bf37bc}{in #bf37bc}.

### A quick note on whitespaces

For most commands you will use `#k` to refer to the $k$-th argument as in LaTeX.
In order to reduce headaches, this forcibly introduces a whitespace on the left of whatever is inserted which, usually, changes nothing visible (e.g. in a math settings).
However there _may be_ situations where you do not want this to happen and you know that the insertion will not clash with anything else.
In that case, you should simply use `!#k` which will not introduce that whitespace.
It's probably easier to see this in action:

\newcommand{\pathwith}[1]{`/usr/local/bin/#1`}
\newcommand{\pathwithout}[1]{`/usr/local/bin/!#1`}

* with: \pathwith{script.jl}, there's a whitespace you don't want ðŸš«
* without: \pathwithout{script.jl} here there isn't âœ…
