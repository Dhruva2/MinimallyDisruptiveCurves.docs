- We met online, as is common these days. She was hanging out on the website template from which I built this documentation. 
- Maruana is a gentleman and a scholar. She is also a **mar**ine ig**uana**. *Amblyrhynchus cristatus*. Do you know what *Ambly* means? Blunt.
- Her native disposition was further sharpened (blunted?) by a traumatic childhood spent [fleeing snakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv9hn4IGofM).
- As such, she has acquired a healthy dislike for all things curve-shaped. Especially those that claim to be minimally disruptive.
