- Marna is a gentleman and a scholar. She is also a marine iguana. *Amblyrhynchus cristatus*. Do you know what *Ambly* means? Blunt.
- Her native disposition was further sharpened by a traumatic childhood spent [fleeing snakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv9hn4IGofM).
- As such, she has acquired a healthy dislike for all things curve-shaped. Especially those that claim to be minimally disruptive.
\\
Marna has expressed her reservations about MinimallyDisruptiveCurves.jl. So we've invited her for a Q&A session.
